<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

Spring Cloud Services 3.0.x can be installed alongside the following earlier versions of Spring Cloud Services:

* 2.0.x
* 1.5.x

Spring Cloud Services 3.0.x includes only the Config Server service. This service has a new name, `p.config-server` (instead of `p-config-server` as in earlier versions of Spring Cloud Services). This service can be offered alongside, but does not replace, earlier versions of Config Server. Pivotal recommends disabling the older `p-config-server` service after installing Spring Cloud Services 3.0.x (which includes the `p.config-server` service).

For more information about running Spring Cloud Services 3.0.x alongside earlier versions, see the [Running Alongside Previous Versions](./installation.html#running-alongside-previous-versions) section of [Installing Spring Cloud&reg; Services for Pivotal Cloud Foundry](./installation.html).
