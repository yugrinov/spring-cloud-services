## Overview

The Spring Cloud Services plugin for the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface tool (cf CLI) adds commands for interacting with Spring Cloud Services service instances. It provides easy access to functionality relating to the Config Server; for example, it can be used to get the configuration used for a service instance or to stop and start a service instance's backing application.

The Spring Cloud Services cf CLI plugin is open-source software released under the [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html) license. From the plugin's [homepage on GitHub](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/spring-cloud-services-cli-plugin), you can raise issues or submit contributions for consideration by the plugin's authors.
