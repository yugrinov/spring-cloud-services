## <a id="self-signed-ssl-certificate"></a>Add Self-Signed SSL Certificate to JVM Truststore

Spring Cloud Services uses HTTPS for all client-to-service communication. If your [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) foundation is using a self-signed SSL certificate, the certificate will need to be added to the JVM truststore before your client app can consume properties from a Config Server service instance.

Spring Cloud Services can add the certificate for you automatically. For this to work, you must set the `TRUST_CERTS` environment variable on your client app to the API endpoint of your Pivotal Application Service (PAS) or Elastic Runtime instance:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf set-env cook TRUST_CERTS api.cf.example.com
Setting env variable 'TRUST_CERTS' to 'api.cf.example.com' for app cook in org myorg / space development as user...
OK
TIP: Use 'cf restage' to ensure your env variable changes take effect

$ cf restage cook
</pre>

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: The <code>CF_TARGET</code> environment variable was formerly recommended for configuring Spring Cloud Services to add a certificate to the truststore. <code>CF_TARGET</code> is still supported for this purpose, but <code>TRUST_CERTS</code> is more flexible and is now recommended instead.</p>

As the output from the ```cf set-env``` command suggests, restage the app after setting the environment variable.
